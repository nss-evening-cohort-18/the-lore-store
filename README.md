## PR Process
1. Check that work was done on a branch seperate from main
2. Work done should be specific to the issue you're working on
If you have to work out of scope make a new branch
3. After creating a PR you should request review from someone on the team (Merging requires one approval)
4. After your branch has been approved, you can merge it into main
5. After your branch has been merged you should test production for any bugs associated with your code

## Reviewer Process
1. Pull down and checkout the branch you are reviewing and scan over for any visual or functional bugs
2. Look at the code diff and look for any potential errors or code smell
3. If you want something changed or have any suggestions, start a thread in the PR
4. If the PR looks good and you feel good about it you can approve it
